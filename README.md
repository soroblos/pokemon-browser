# Wireframe

This was the initial wireframe. Most of it stayed pretty true to the design, except the concept changed from Marvel to Pokemon.

# Resources used

I used quite an array of resources from past class videos and classworks to helpful websites and videos.

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBzsE0oieio)
site helped me with majority of the functionality for the attempt at a carousel in my code

https://pokemon2020.pokemon.com/en-us/

I learned most of what i knew about how to create a modal from [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-modal-with-javascript/) but it wasnt simply copy and paste because for all of the code used i tried my best to understand how each piece works. From mixing different parts of the code to see what would happen to trying to figure out how to do the rest on my own i have a pretty good understanding on most of the code used on my site.

# Hardest Problems
I would say the carousel was definetly the hardest part of my entire website but once i understood parent child relationships and how i can find them within the DOM it got significantly easier understanding the relationship between different object and how i can manipulate that and most of that knowledge came from [this-site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHuSz4fRM88&t=485s)



# Unsolved Problems 
1. I didnt complete my carousel so it only goes through its rotation once and has no left but functionality.

1. I wanted to include a link to a site for each specific pokemon within the modal(just didnt have enough time)

1. My code has no dryness whatsoever and I mean None.
